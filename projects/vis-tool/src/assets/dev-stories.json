          "description": "\n <b>What am I looking at? </b> \n <p>This Pheno Forecast shows the first locations (in yellow) to reach the required accumulation of heat to trigger emergence of eastern tent caterpillars in 2019, which occured on March 10. The map also shows bands of color indicating locations that are 2-3 weeks, 1-2 weeks, and 7 days away from emergence, as well as those that are in areas of delining activity and past the time of caterpillar activity.</p> \n <b>What does this tell me?</b> \n <p>Our Pheno Forecasts predict key life cycle stages in invasive and pest species. These maps help managers to know when to expect emergence to more effectively plan treatment actities. Learn more about these Pheno Forecasts at <a href=\"https://www.usanpn.org/data/forecasts\" target=\"_blank\">www.usanpn.org/data/forecasts</a>.</p> \n <b>How can I modify this visualization?</b> \n <p>We have Pheno Forecasts available for other insect pests and invasive plants. You can change the species displayed by selecting from the Base Layer menu. You can also use the Base Layer menu to change the date of the forecast by choosing a date from the calendar. You can also add observations of eastern tent caterpillars collected through Nature's Notebook by going to the Species/Phenophase menu and selecting a Species (or higher Taxonomic group) and Phenophase Class.</p>",
