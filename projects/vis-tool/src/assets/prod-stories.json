The long-term average of accumulation over the period of 1991-2020 is shown in black, the current year in blue, and the prior year in orange. You can also see the prediction for accumulation over the next 6 days, shown in red.</p> \n <b>What does this tell me?</b> \n <p>Heat accumulation is a metric of climate that is a common driver of phenological activity. Many species respond by leafing, flowering, or emerging at particular heat accumulation thresholds. This graph can show you whether heat is accumulating faster than normal where you live, which may mean earlier than average signs of phenological activity.</p> \n <b>How can I modify this graph?</b> \n <p>If there is a particular heat accumulation threshold that is of interest to you, you can set the threshold in the Features menu to see if it has been met and if so, when.

        "description": "\n <b>What am I looking at?</b> \n <p>This map shows the predicted Spring First Bloom Index, overlaid with icons showing reported open flowers in flowering dogwood (<i>Cornus florida</i>). The map is based on an integrative model that predicts the start of spring called the <a href=\"https://www.usanpn.org/news/spring\" target=\"_blank\">Spring Indices</a>. This model was developed using a long-term dataset of lilacs and honeysuckles and has been identified as a climate change indicator by the <a href=\"https://www.globalchange.gov/browse/indicators/indicator-start-spring\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Global Change Research Program</a>. </p> \n <b>What does this tell me?</b> \n <p>This visualization shows how the First Bloom map, which is based on a predictive model of early-season plant blooming, aligns with reports of open flowers in dogwoods. Icons that are a similar color to the map show locations where reports of open flowers match up with predicted blooming.</p> \n <b>How can I modify this visualization?</b> \n <p>You can change the Species and Pheno Classes displayed in the Species/Phenophase menu. You can change the map displayed by changing the Layer Category in the Base Layer menu. Within the Spring Indices category, you can display either the Leaf or Bloom model, and view annual historical maps and current year status and anomaly maps.</p>",
